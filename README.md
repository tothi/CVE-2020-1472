# ZeroLogon exploit script

A Python script that uses the Impacket library to exploit the vulnerability for the Zerologon exploit (CVE-2020-1472).

It attempts to perform the Netlogon authentication bypass. ~~The script will immediately terminate when succesfully 
performing the bypass, and not perform any Netlogon operations.~~ The scipt will immediately exploit the vulnerability,
and resets the computer password with an empty password. When a domain controller is patched, the detection 
script will give up after sending 2000 pairs of RPC calls and conclude the target is not vulnerable (with a 
false negative chance of 0.04%).

## Installation

Requires Python 3.7 or higher and Pip. Also requires the latest [Impacket toolset](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket),
especially the [recent commit](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/pull/951) by
[@_dirkjan](https://twitter.com/_dirkjan) (who made it possible to write a super-easy exploit).

## Running the script

The script targets can be used to target a DC or backup DC. It likely also works against a read-only DC, but this has 
not been tested. Given a domain controller named `EXAMPLE-DC` with IP address `1.2.3.4`, run the script as follows:

    ./zerologon_tester.py EXAMPLE-DC 1.2.3.4

The DC name should be its NetBIOS computer name. If this name is not correct, the script will likely fail with a 
`STATUS_INVALID_COMPUTER_NAME` error.
